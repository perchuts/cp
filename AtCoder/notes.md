# Some problem notes
Just leaving notes on some problems. There are problems in which i find the solution beautiful, or my solution is completely different from editorial's. I just want to register such things here.

<summary> [ARC156C](https://atcoder.jp/contests/arc156/tasks/arc156_c) </summary>
Thought of a construction using the centroid of the tree. It pairs nodes from different subtrees (p[x] = y, p[y] = x) and nodes with lower height are paired first.). Edi solution is kinda trivial, much easier than mine, but I thought that this construction and its proof are cute.

<summary> [ABC366G](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc366/tasks/abc366_g) </summary>
Interesting XOR Basis problem! Although constraints make it not too hard to come up with the solution

<summary> [ABC346G](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc346/tasks/abc346_g) </summary>
Solved using Divide and Conquer + ordered set. Works in O(n log^2 n), but runs kinda fast (~600ms)
